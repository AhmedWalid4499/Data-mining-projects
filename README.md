# Data Mining projects

## Mini project 1 

In this project, we were requested to Preprocess the data: Remove redundant data, apply normalization if needed, remove null value, etc. 
Then, we were asked to use visualization tools like Histograms and catplots to visualize certain queries that we were asked to conduct. 

## Mini Porject 2

In this project, our main traget wasn't to learn how to preprocess, but of course it was a requirment. In the project, our main target was to apply clustering tecniques to the data given to us: A spotify database. Also, as a bonus, there is a small reccomender system coded that takes a genre, and generate five genres that are within the same cluster as the genre used as an input

## Mini Project 3

In this project, our main target was to extract assossiaction rules from the data given to us.
